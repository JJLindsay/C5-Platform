# C5-Platform (currently in development)
<br/>
A retro platform game that, when finished, will offer a more flexible game engine (than tappy defender), 
<br/>
a level builder, scrolling backgrounds, and level transitions

###Current State

<ol>
<li> UPDATE 2: added sound and a basic animation that makes use of the spriteSheet to show the different angles of the main
character.
</li>
<li> UPDATE 1: Added the first 2 game objects: player and grass. Added the framework for Level Cave that currently display 4 objects:
player, and 3 grass objects. There is also a level manager that will grab the right level and set it up. Platform view is also more fleshed out.
</li>

<li>  TODO ...
</li>
</ol>
